# *Guidelines while writing:
# 1. Include javadocs with your function. In function comments are not necessary, but make sure the javadocs are descriptive.
# 2. Give variables descriptive names. Other than counter variables, each variables name should in some way describe its purpose.
# 3. Do not mix styles. Maintain a style (ex. either CamelCase or Underscore_Seperators). 
# 4. Write in Java, not assembly. If you are trying to double the value of a number, don't do it by shifting left one. compilers do that automatically. We all know how binary operations work, don't try and show off. It just makes it more confusing as to what you are actually trying to do. Obviously if you are actually trying to manipulate bits, use shifting not multiplication.
