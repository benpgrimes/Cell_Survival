# Cell_Survival

# Guidelines while writing:
# 1. Include javadocs with your function. In function comments are not necessary, but make sure the javadocs are descriptive.
# 2. Give variables descriptive names. Other than counter variables, each variables name should in some way describe its purpose.
# 3. Do not mix styles. Maintain a style (ex. either CamelCase or Underscore_Seperators). 
# 4. Write in Java, not assembly.
# 5.
